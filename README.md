# Hawk-Eye-Technical-Challenge

Ran out of time when trying to implement data being stored with timestamps.

TASK OVERVIEW »
Your task is to create a class (or classes) which can store data and provide various statistics. The number of items should be configurable: the oldest data should be removed when new data comes in. It should be possible to get the following information about the data:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Sum
4. Standard deviation

EXTENSIONS »
- Can one class provide all the functionality, or do you need separate classes?
- Can more generic data be stored? How would you handle getting the statistics of them?
- Can the data be queried for a specific range rather than getting all of the data?
- Can the data be stored with timestamps such that the maximum range of data stored is
over a specified time rather than a specified amount?
- Is there any other functionality you feel would be useful for this class?
- Consider multi-threaded applications where the thread reading the data might not be the
same one that is writing it.
